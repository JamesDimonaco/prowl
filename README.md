## What is PageAlert?

PageAlert monitors any website using AI. Paste a URL, describe what you're looking for in plain English, and get notified via email when your conditions are met.

- Track product availability and restocks
- Monitor price drops across any store
- Watch for new listings on job boards, classifieds, or auction sites
- No CSS selectors or code required — just describe what you want

## How it works

1. **Paste a URL** — any website with products, listings, or data you care about
2. **Describe what you want** — "MacBook Pro M4 Max under $3000 in black"
3. **AI extracts the data** — understands the page structure, finds items, generates match filters
4. **Get notified** — email alerts when your conditions are met, with direct links to matched items
